# Getting started with InnmindProvisionerBundle

## Installation

Installation is done in 3 very little steps:

* [Installation](installation.md)

## Behaviour

* [General understanding](behaviour.md)
* [RabbitMQ predictions](rabbitmq.md)

## Extending the Bundle

Because you could want to use the provision mechanism to run other commands as the RabbitMQ ones, the bundle is built in a way you can easily extend it in your applications.

* [Extend](extend.md)
* [Trigger tuning](trigger-tuning.md)
